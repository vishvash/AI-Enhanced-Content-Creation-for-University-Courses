What are the four conceptual components of a learning agent? VISH
An intelligent agent is a self-directed entity that acts upon its environment using sensors and actuators to achieve certain goals. It can learn from its environment. VISH
The four rules for an intelligent agent are:
1. Ability to perceive the environment
2. Observation
3. Decision
4. Rational action. VISH
A simple reflex agent works on a condition-action rule, which means it maps the current state to an action. A model-based reflex agent can work in a partially observable environment and track the situation. VISH
The main advantage of using a goal-based agent is that it can expand the capabilities of the model-based agent with additional information about the "goal". VISH
The four conceptual components of a learning agent are:
1. Learning element
2. Critic
3. Performance element
4. Problem generator. VISH

Describe the concept of "internal state" in the context of a model-based reflex agent. VISH
A model-based reflex agent can operate in partially observable environments, while a simple reflex agent relies solely on the current state. VISH
The four components of a learning agent are: learning element, critic, performance element, and problem generator. VISH
The critic component in a learning agent provides feedback to the learning element, evaluating the performance of the agent and suggesting improvements. VISH
A utility-based agent extends the goal-based agent by incorporating a utility measurement capability, allowing it to choose actions that maximize the expected utility, while a goal-based agent simply aims to achieve a specific goal. VISH
The internal state of a model-based reflex agent represents the current situation based on the history of percepts. It helps the agent track the environment and make informed decisions even in partially observable situations. VISH
